## What's this?

Ruby & JS have been my daily languages for over a decade. Time to learn something new! 

To help me learn Golang and become more proficient in it, here's some Advent of Code solutions in the gopher language.

## Goal

1) Get a working solution to each problem

2) Iterate on the solution, improving it's runtime efficiency and make it more Go-like in its idioms and language feature usages.
   
3) Write tests, in order to become comfortable with writing production-quality code in Golang.
